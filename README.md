## Installation

Requirements. Install dependencies with pip

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run `utilization_test.py` to plot dependence of the average waiting time on the QS utilization factor

Run `channels_test.py` to plot dependence of the average waiting time on the channels number

Run `cooling_delay_test.py` to plot dependence of the average waiting time on the mean cooling delay

Run `optimize_delta.py` to plot dependence of the loss function on the mean cooling delay
